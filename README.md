This was my portfolio for InsightGlobal

The live.html and the LiveTest folder can be run in sync, if you start the LiveTest.exe and then navigate to the live.html on the same pc the website and the desktop app will connect and sync data between them in real-time. (On the webpage you have to hit enter to see the changes on the desktop app). This also shows my skills in JavaScript (although short and sweet)

The index.php and framework folder are a framework that I wrote from scratch to showcase my PHP skills.
